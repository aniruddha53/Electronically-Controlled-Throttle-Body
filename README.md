# Electronically-Controlled-Throttle-Body

Throttle Body:

A throttle is the mechanism by which fluid flow is managed by construction or obstruction. When a throttle is wide open, 
the intake manifolds usually at ambient atmospheric pressure. When the throttle is partially closed, a manifold vacuum 
develops as the intake drops below ambient pressure. The Throttle Body is the part of the air intake system that controls 
the amount of air flowing into the engine, in response to driver accelerator pedal input in the main. 

Electronically Controlled Throttle Body:

Electronic throttle control is an automobile technology which electronically "connects" the accelerator pedal to the throttle,
replacing a mechanical linkage. Electronic throttle controls establish the essential connection between the acceleration pedal
and the throttle valve using electronic signals instead of a mechanical link.

Accomplishment:

Successfully created a prototype of Electronically controlled throttle body with the help of following components:
1. LM 339 comparator IC 
2. L293D Motor Driver IC
3. 12V Motor
4. Potentiometer, Resistors
